# RequestHub

RequestHub is a decentralized application built on top of the Request Network. Users can connect their wallets to the application and get important information about their transactions, such as personalized transactions, inflow, outflow, income, outcome, pending invoices, overdue invoices, etc. One unique and highly useful feature for banking applications is the credit score, which can be used by banks for loan approvals. Users can easily filter all their invoices based on dates, payee, payer, reason, etc.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

bash
npm run dev

# or

yarn dev

# or

pnpm dev

# or

bun dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Usage
